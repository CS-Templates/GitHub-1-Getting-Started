## Overview

<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png" align="right"> Today you are going to create an account on [GitHub][] (contol-click on this link to open it in another tab) one of the better known sites for hosting [Git][] repositories. Git is a _source code management_ system – a tool to help keep track of the change in software projects, like Unity games. When things go wrong, git can help you figure out what changed, and who change it. That's the first step towards fixing it.

Here is an overview of what you will be doing today:

* Create an account on GitHub.
* Practice working with Git and GitHub.
* Turn on the [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] web site – we'll use this later to host our games.
* Practice by making a few changes to your website.

To finish this assignment you will need a working e-mail account that you can access. If you alread have one, that's great, use it. Otherwise, you will need to set one up. Until you verify your e-mail address, your GitHub Pages site will not be active. You can do everything else without a working e-mail.

## First Things First

In order to complete this assignment:

1. Make sure you have a working e-mail account where you can check your e-mail.

## The Details:

Here's what to do, in detail:

### Create an account on GitHub

1. Click on the link to go to [GitHub (https://github.com)][github].
2. Select a user name that you will be comfortable sharing with colleagues and potential employers. If you can get it your name is a good choice.
3. Enter your e-mail.
4. Enter the password you want to use. You may want to type it "in the clear" so that you can be sure it is right. Note that you don't have a password verification box.
5. Once you have created the account click on the avatar in the upper right hand corner and choose Settings from the dropdown menu, then enter your name (as I know you). This is especially important if you didn't use your name as your GitHub username.
6. Then choose Profile from the same dropdown – it will take you to your GitHub profile page. Bookmark this page.

## Submit The Assignment

When you are done, submit the assignment:

* Click on your GitHub bookmark to take you to your GitHub profile, then copy the URL.
* On Canvas (you're here, right?) paste the URL into the submission box.
* At the end of class, in your notebook, reflect on how it went today:
  - Select the next blank page and date it and title it "Starting GitHub" would not be a bad choice of title for today.
  - What is something that "clicked" for your? Perhaps, how do you think we might use Git and GitHub on our final project?
  - Did you get stuck or lost today? Where? Do you know why?
  - What do you need to do next?
