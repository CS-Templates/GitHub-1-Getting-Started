## Overview

<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png" align="right"> Today you are going to create an account on [GitHub][] (contol-click on this link to open it in another tab) one of the better known sites for hosting [Git][] repositories. Git is a _source code management_ system – a tool to help you keep track of the changes in your software projects, like Unity games. When things go wrong, git can help you figure out what changed, and who changed it. That's often the first step towards fixing it.

Here is an overview of what you will be doing today:

* Create an account on GitHub.
* Practice working with Git and GitHub.
* Turn on the [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] web site – we'll use this later to host our games.
* Practice by making a few changes to your website.

To finish this assignment you will need a working e-mail account that you can access. If you alread have one, that's great, use it. Otherwise, you will need to set one up. Until you verify your e-mail address, your GitHub Pages site will not be active. You can do everything else without a working e-mail.

## First Things First

In order to complete this assignment you will need an e-mail account where you can receive e-mail. If you don't have one, now would be a good time to set one up. If you have concerns about setting one up, please see me.

## The Details:

Here's what to do, in detail:

### Create an account on GitHub

1. Click on the link to go to [GitHub (https://github.com)][github].
2. Select a user name that you will be comfortable sharing with colleagues and potential employers. If you can get it, your name is a good choice.
3. Enter your e-mail address.
4. Enter the password you want to use. You may want to type it "in the clear" so that you can be sure it is right. Note that you don't have a password verification box, so whatever you type for a password will be accepted - even if it is not what you meant to type.
5. Once you have created the account click on the *avatar* in the upper right hand corner and choose **Settings** from the dropdown menu, then enter your name (as I know you). This is especially important if you didn't use your name as your GitHub username.
6. Then choose **Profile** from the same dropdown – it will take you to your GitHub profile page. **Bookmark this page,** you will visit it often.

## Submit The Assignment

When you are done, submit the assignment:

* Click on your GitHub bookmark to take you to your GitHub profile, then copy the URL. **Note well:** GitHub's use of the term _Profile_ is confusing. They use to mean different things in almost the same place... Sorry about that. The profile that you want is the one that you get by clicking on the `+` dropdown menu in the upper right hand corner of the GitHub window. The resulting URL will read:

  
  https://github.com/***your user name***
  
* On Canvas (you're here, right?) paste the URL into the submission box.
* At the end of class, in your notebook, reflect on how it went today:
  - Select the next blank page and date it and title it "Starting GitHub" would not be a bad choice of title for today.
  - What is something that "clicked" for your? Perhaps, how do you think we might use Git and GitHub on our final project?
  - Did you get stuck or lost today? Where? Do you know why?
  - What do you need to do next?
